# Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning

A structured, beginner-friendly guide to foundational machine learning algorithms  from **supervised learning** (like regression and perceptrons) to **reinforcement learning** and **unsupervised clustering**.

Each concept is explained with:
-  Intuitive Markdown tutorials  
-  Formulas and equations  
-  Real-world analogies  
-  ASCII diagrams and flowcharts
- Python Code

##  Topics Covered

### 1.  Supervised Learning

####  Linear Regression
- Understand how machines learn to predict numerical outcomes.
- Formula breakdown and error minimization.
- Visuals for gradients and cost functions.

####  Perceptron Learning
- The foundation of neural networks.
- Learn how a binary classifier updates weights using errors.

---

### 2.  Reinforcement Learning

####  Markov Decision Processes (MDP)
- Explore how agents navigate environments using rewards and penalties.
- Concepts of states, actions, transitions, and reward functions.

####  Q-Learning
- Learn how agents estimate future rewards to act optimally.
- Update rules, ε-greedy exploration, and real-world examples.

### 3.  Unsupervised Learning

####  Clustering
- Learn how algorithms group similar data without labels.
- Applications in genetics, image segmentation, and more.

####  k-Means Clustering
- Step-by-step process: initialization → assignment → update → convergence.
- Visual examples using 3 cluster states for clarity.
